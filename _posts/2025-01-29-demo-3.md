Silver and bighead carps were imported from China to the United States
in the 1970s as a biological control mechanism for improving water
quality. After escaping captivity, both species spread into the Mississippi
River Basin and now threaten to enter the Great Lakes. Human con-
sumption is one solution, but many Americans believe that carp is
unsavory. A random sample of 2,000 licensed anglers in Missouri was
asked to complete a mail-back questionnaire about Asian carp, yielding
a 27% response rate (n = 465). Results indicated that knowledge and
perception about carp were poor, and food neophobia (fear of new
foods) scores were above average. Less than 15% of respondents had
eaten carp, but nearly 53% were willing to try. Marketing should focus
on the bene ts of consumption while downplaying any possible con-
cerns. Although education programs are worthwhile, taste might be
more in uential to change public attitudes toward Asian carp.
