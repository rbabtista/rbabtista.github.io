Chances are, you've either watched a YouTube
video of silver carp leaping from the water or
seen one, up close and personal. Although it
might seem humorous when somebody gets smacked
by a flying fish, there's nothing funny about the
impact of a 10 to 20-pound piscine projectile. They
can inflict a lot of bodily harm or property damage. If
the menace of the Midwest landed in your boat, then
you experienced a slimy and bloody mess trying to
remove it. Oxygen depletion in late summer can result
in massive die-offs, causing a putrid odor to linger
on tourism and local economies. Untold numbers of
carp are discarded into landfills each year. That's what
happened to 119 tons of them after being harvested
from Creve Coeur Lake, near St. Louis, in 2018.
Asian carp is a collective term used to describe four
species: bighead, grass, silver, and black. The common
carp was introduced into America during the early
1800s as a food source for our growing immigrant
population. That experiment failed miserably.
Common carp are invasive, but they have been around
long enough to become naturalized citizens. In the
1970s, silver and bighead carp were imported into the
U.S. as a biological control mechanism to improve
water quality. After escaping captivity in southeast
Arkansas, the Asian carp population exploded
throughout the Mississippi River and its tributaries,
thanks to ample space and food, high reproduction,
and frequent flooding. For example, the Illinois River
has more Asian carp than any place on the planet.
High densities of Asian carp pose serious problems in big
river systems since they reduce the number of planktonic
organisms in the water column that otherwise would
be available for native fish, such as gizzard shad. To
prevent Asian carp from entering Lake Michigan, the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers has spent billions of taxpayer
dollars to electrify the shipping canals around Chicago.
If Asian carp infest the Great Lakes, they will disrupt a
multibillion-dollar commercial and recreational fishing
industry. Although the electric current is an effective
deterrent for Asian carp, it does nothing to lower their
population. There's a lot at stake.
Invasive species are nearly impossible to eradicate
after occupying a niche. Angling is not practical since
Asian carp cannot be caught by rod and reel, except for
snagging. Commercial harvest is a viable option, but the
supply of fish is much larger than current demand. Some
outlets include fertilizer, pet food, and fish bait, but
additional markets are needed. Human consumption is a
possible solution, but many Missourians consider Asian
carp to be 'trash' fish because of their appearance and
bone structure. If it looks worthless, then it must be!
Here's the good news. Silver carp are a plentiful and
inexpensive food source that contains high amounts
of macro and micronutrients, such as protein, iron,
potassium, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, and nine
essential amino acids. They have low levels of heavy
metals, such as mercury, because of their mid-stream
feeding behavior (not all carp are bottom-feeders). The
white meat has a mild flavor that absorbs spices and
seasonings well. I've eaten silver carp in tacos, burritos,
nachos, chili, dumplings, and omelets, but my favorite is
sausage links. A recent study conducted at the University
of Missouri found that people liked silver carp's taste
over catfish by a wide margin.
Although eating invasive species isn't new, using
silver carp to address hunger relief and malnutrition
in women and children is an overlooked management
strategy. Over 820 million people worldwide (about 1 in
9) suffer from undernourishment. Many of them live in
   developing countries where food insecurity can result
   in social and political unrest. In other words, food is
   democracy in action. Let's consider the situation in Haiti.
   Feature Story
   Haiti is one of the largest countries in the Caribbean
   with a population of over 11 million. It is also one of
   the poorest countries in the Western hemisphere since
   59% of Haitians live in extreme poverty (< $2.42 per
   day). Nearly half of Haiti's population (about 5.4 million)
   are undernourished. About 1 in 5 Haitian children are
   chronically malnourished, often resulting in irreversible
   physical and mental disabilities, including suppressed
   immune systems. Three common problems are stunting,
   wasting, and iron deficiency anemia – especially common
   among women of reproductive age.
   To make matters worse, Haiti is prone to natural
   disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Few places
   in the world are needier. So, I traveled to Haiti recently
   and fed villagers with some freshly-smoked carp from
   Midwest rivers. It was a life-changing experience. Please

   After returning home, I recruited some MU professors
   to work with me on this project, including natural
   resources, food science, and engineering. It was an easy
   sell. I'm also collaborating with scientists in Vietnam,
   South Africa, and Nigeria, and three humanitarian aid
   organizations in Missouri: Glory House Services in
   Kansas City, Convoy of Hope in Springfield, and Meds &
   Food for Kids in St. Louis. They caught the vision, will
   you?
   I hope your will consider supporting my research project
   that uses a locally grown, harvested, and processed
   food source that addresses two important but unrelated
   issues – invasive species and malnutrition. Together, we
   can take a bite out of carp and feed hungry people at the
   same time, and it's a win-win. The average-size Asian
   carp is worth about $1. Use this link to make your tax-
