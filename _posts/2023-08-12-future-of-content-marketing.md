Inexpensive sources of protein are in high demand at many charitable organizations. However, the product would need a long shelf-life, without the need for canning, refrigeration, or freezing. Our study focused on salting and smoking the fish. To minimize hypertension, a portion of potassium chloride (KCL) was substituted for table salt (NaCl).

## Abstract

The spread of Asian carp throughout the Mississippi River Basin, including its tributaries, has resulted in numerous problems to aquatic ecosystems. Relatively few strategies are in place to reduce their growing population. One overlooked solution is use of carp for humanitarian aid. Inexpensive sources of protein are in high demand at many charitable organizations. However, the product would need a long shelf-life, without the need for canning, refrigeration, or freezing. Our study focused on salting and smoking the fish. To minimize hypertension, a portion of potassium chloride (KCL) was substituted for table salt (NaCl). Each mixture contained some sugar to improve taste. Tests to determine water activity, mold, and yeast were conducted to ensure product safety. With logistical support from Glory House Services in Kansas City, Missouri, a sample of Asian carp was delivered to Haiti in March, 2018. The project was successful since villagers ate the product and wanted more of it.
